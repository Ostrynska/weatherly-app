### Features:

1. **City List with Weather Cards**:
   - Display a list of cities as cards.
   - Each card contains:
     - Brief weather information.
     - On click: shows detailed information, navigates to a detailed page or deletes card.
   - A button to refresh the weather data for the specific city.

2. **Add/Remove Cities**:
   - Add new cities to the list. A request is sent to fetch the current weather, and the city is displayed immediately.
   - Remove cities from the list.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Store the list of cities in **LocalStorage**.
   - On page reload:
     - Previously selected cities remain visible.
     - Weather data is updated automatically.

4. **Detailed Weather View** *(Bonus)*:
   - Display a graphical representation of temperature based on its value using hourly forecasts for the current day.
